## Some timer app

This timer app is as straightforward as it gets - free of ads and other BS that
usually clogs your screen.

### How to use it?

Just go full screen on your laptop and let the huge red background do its job of
catching your attention. Access it [here](https://timer.itsmattch.com/) - no
strings attached.

### Want to suggest a feature?

Think twice. This app thrives on its simplicity. But hey, if you have something
mind-blowingly simple and cool, pop open a new issue or pull request. I'm all
ears.

### It's not responsive!!1

Duh. Your phone's probably got a pre-installed timer app, use that.
